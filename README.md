# devo

devo is simple version manager for deno


## Usage

write version in `.devo`

```
v1.0.0
```

devo consumes same commands as deno and install a specific version you want automatically

```
devo <same subcommands as deno>
```

If you didn't provide any version, devo just run current `deno` version
